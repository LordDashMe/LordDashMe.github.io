### Usage

#### Development

- Use this registered custom npm script command ```npm run start:dev``` to start developing with exposed port stated in the CLI output.

- Note: The Development mode right now is not stable as you may see, because in the Development mode all the assets are loaded across all pages. So better to test it with Pre Production Build files.

##### Testing Pre Production Build Files

- To clean the gatsby build files: ```npm run build:clean```.

- To build the current source code: ```npm run build```.

- To serve the actual build files with temporary server: ```npm run build:serve```.

#### Production

- Execute the restore command in the root directory ```./pre-deployment.sh``` to clean all build files.

- Then use this command ```npm run build:deploy``` to deploy the build files in the root directory.
